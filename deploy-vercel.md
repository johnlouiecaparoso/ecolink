# EcoLink Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Router Logic**: Updated router to allow unauthenticated users to access the new HomepageView
2. **Service Worker**: Updated cache version to v1.1.0 to force cache refresh
3. **Public Routes**: Added homepage, marketplace, and other public routes to the public routes list

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache** (if needed):
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Go to Application tab
   - Clear storage
   - Or visit: `your-domain.com/clear-cache.js`

## Key Changes Made

### Router Updates (`src/router/index.js`)

- Fixed navigation logic to show HomepageView for unauthenticated users
- Added public routes for homepage, marketplace, etc.
- Removed redirect to login for homepage access

### Service Worker Updates (`public/sw.js`)

- Updated cache version from v1.0.2 to v1.1.0
- This forces a cache refresh on deployment

### Main.js Updates (`src/main.js`)

- Re-enabled service worker registration
- Added cache clearing functionality

## Testing

After deployment:

1. Open the site in an incognito/private window
2. Check that the new HomepageView loads (not the old dashboard)
3. Verify mobile navigation works properly
4. Test authentication flow

## Troubleshooting

If old interface still shows:

1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Check Vercel deployment logs
3. Verify all files are properly built
4. Check network tab for any 404 errors
