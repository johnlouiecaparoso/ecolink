-- Anti-double-counting for retirement.
--
-- Retiring credits must atomically reduce the owner's balance and can never
-- drive it negative — this is what prevents the same carbon unit from being
-- retired (or sold) twice. We add a DB-level guard plus an atomic RPC that
-- decrements only when the balance is sufficient.

-- Backstop: an owner's balance can never go below zero (NOT VALID so any
-- legacy rows are not retroactively rejected, but all future writes are).

-- Atomic retirement decrement. Returns true only if a single ownership row had
-- enough credits and was decremented; false otherwise (caller aborts).
