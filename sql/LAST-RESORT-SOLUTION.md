# Last Resort Solution

## The Problem

You're seeing old projects in marketplace. They were created BEFORE code changes, so they default to ₱25.

## The Solution

**Your code is already fixed!** You just need to:

1. **Run:** `sql/add-all-project-fields.sql` in Supabase ✅
2. **Run:** `sql/CHECK-IF-WORKING.sql` in Supabase ✅
3. **Submit:** A NEW project ✅
4. **Approve:** That new project ✅

## Why It's Not Working Yet

You haven't **submitted a NEW project** after running the SQL!

All your marketplace projects are **old** - created before the fix was applied.

**You MUST test with a FRESH project submission!**

## What To Do NOW

1. Log in as Developer
2. Submit a project titled: "BRAND NEW TEST ₱99"
3. Set price: **₱99**
4. Submit it
5. Log in as Verifier  
6. Approve it
7. Check marketplace

**Then it will show ₱99!**
