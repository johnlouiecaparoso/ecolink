# 🧭 Carbonify / Ecolink — Updated Development Board

> **Updated:** 2026-06-05
> **Source:** Reconciled against the original `Carbonify_Notion_Template.md` and the original `Carbonify_Development_Plan.pdf`.
> **Purpose:** Show what the codebase **actually implements today** vs. the original 14-week MVP plan, then re-plan the remaining work.

---

## 📋 Overview

The original plan targeted a **14-week, 7-sprint MVP** for a Philippine carbon-credit registry + marketplace ("Carbonify"). The product is now implemented as **Ecolink** — a Vue 3 + Supabase single-page app. Most of the original MVP scope is **done and exceeded** (full MRV module, verifier-gated issuance, tamper-evident QR certificates, KYC, 6 user roles, real payment gateway). The remaining work is no longer "build the MVP" — it is **production-hardening money flows, institutional compliance, and a mobile app.**

### ⚠️ Key deviations from the original plan
| Plan said | Built instead | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Auth: Firebase / Auth0 | **Supabase Auth** | Aligns with the PDF's "Authentication: Supabase". The Notion doc's Firebase/Auth0 line is superseded. |
| Payments: GCash/Maya **SDK** (direct) | **PayMongo** gateway (GCash, Maya, cards as methods) | Direct GCash/Maya SDK custody not pursued; PayMongo is the PSP. |
| Mobile: **React Native** app | **Not started** | Web SPA only. Mobile MVP (Sprint 6) is the largest unbuilt block. |
| KYC: Persona/Veriff/Jumio | **In-house KYC form + admin review** | No 3rd-party ID-verification integration yet. |
| Blockchain certificates (optional) | **SHA-256 tamper-evident signature + QR** | Blockchain explicitly deferred. |

**Legend:** ✅ Implemented · 🟡 Partial · ❌ Not implemented

- [x] ✅ Unit/integration test harness — Vitest, MSW, Playwright configured (`package.json`)
- [ ] 🟡 UAT — not formally recorded

## 🗺 Re-Planned Roadmap (remaining work)

The 14-week MVP is effectively complete on web. The next phases move from "prototype" to "real marketplace."

### 🔴 Phase A — Money Foundation (production blocker)
- [ ] Move payment amounts server-side (Edge Functions authoritative)
- [ ] Signed webhook as source of truth + idempotency keys
- [ ] Double-entry `ledger_entries` table; stop direct balance writes
- [ ] Daily reconciliation vs. PayMongo settlement
- [ ] Escrow hold/release for marketplace trades
- [ ] *See `docs/PAYMENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md`*

### 🟠 Phase B — Get Sellers Paid
- [ ] Seller payout / disbursement service
- [ ] Withdraw backend (complete the existing UI)
- [ ] KYB (business verification) for sellers
- [ ] Seller sales/earnings dashboard (un-hide `SalesView.vue`)
- [ ] Listing price-edit & inventory management; oversell hardening

### 🟡 Phase C — Trust & Compliance
- [ ] Public searchable registry (projects/credits/retirements)
- [ ] Double-claim/retirement uniqueness prevention
- [ ] AML/sanctions screening; velocity limits
- [ ] Data Privacy Act tooling (consent, export, delete)
- [ ] Admin system-config UI (emission factors, fees, KYC tiers)
- [ ] CSV/PDF report export (admin + buyer ESG report + LGU ESG report)
- [ ] 3rd-party KYC (Persona/Veriff/Jumio)

### 📱 Phase D — Mobile
- [ ] Decide: **React Native vs. responsive PWA** (PWA likely faster from existing Vue SPA)
- [ ] Login, wallet, marketplace, certificate viewer
- [ ] Push notifications

### 🟢 Phase E — Future / Optional
- [ ] Blockchain tokenization (immutable ledger)
- [ ] Article 6 / national-registry interoperability
- [ ] Verifier SLA queue, adjustable VERs, two-way comment threads
- [ ] LGU benchmarking & land-use carbon modeling
