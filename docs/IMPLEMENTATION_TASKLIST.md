# PART C — Recommended Build Order (milestones)

| Milestone | Focus | Key tasks |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Money foundation** | Make real money safe | B1: server‑side payments, webhook‑as‑truth, ledger, idempotency, reconciliation, provider abstraction (B2) |
| **M2 — Get paid / get trust** | Close the two biggest blockers | B1 seller payouts + sales dashboard + price mgmt; B2 real‑credit supplier API + project detail page |
| **M3 — Workflow + reporting** | Finish core loops | B3 edit/resubmit, comment thread, verifier checklist + adjustable VERs; B1 admin finance console; B2 ESG report |
| **M4 — Compliance** | Operate legally | B4 system config, reports/exports, AML + DPA tooling, user lifecycle |
| **M5 — Experience & LGU** | Adoption | B5 buyer experience; B6 LGU exports/tracker/charts |
| **M6 — Scale & transparency** | Production hardening | B7 public registry, DR/backups, B1 oversell hardening; observability |
| **M7 — Future** | Institutional depth | B8 blockchain, Article 6, VVB, methodologies (mostly business/legal) |

> **Single most impactful next step:** **M1 (money foundation) + seller payouts** — today developers cannot get paid and admins cannot see money, which blocks Ecolink from being a real marketplace. Everything else builds cleanly on that base.
