# Ecolink — System Analysis, Benchmark & Gap Report

**Prepared:** June 2026
**Scope:** Implementation status against the SRD + Platform Review, a benchmark against real‑world carbon registries, and a rating of what is still missing.
**Nature of the system:** Academic capstone prototype (Vue 3 + Supabase/PostgreSQL) architected toward real‑world Philippine carbon‑market use.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Ecolink has moved well beyond a "simple project listing" prototype. Over six implementation phases it now covers the **full lifecycle** the SRD describes — registration → validation → MRV → verification → issuance → marketplace → trading → retirement — with serialized carbon units, server‑side emission‑reduction calculation, verifier‑gated issuance, KYC, MFA, an LGU tool suite, and a public certificate‑verification page.

| Lens | Rating | One‑line verdict |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **vs. the capstone SRD** | **9.0 / 10** | Nearly all functional requirements implemented; only "future module" items remain. |
| **vs. the Platform Review (PH eligibility)** | **8.5 / 10** | 7 of 8 improvement areas substantially delivered; blockchain + a few data fields outstanding. |
| **vs. a real‑world production registry (Verra/Gold Standard class)** | **4.5 / 10** | Has the *shape* of a registry, but lacks accredited third‑party VVBs, approved methodologies, independent governance, interoperability/Article 6, and registry‑grade immutability. |

**Bottom line:** As a capstone demonstrating a credible, PH‑aligned carbon platform, Ecolink is strong and largely feature‑complete. To operate as a *real* registry it would need external accreditation, methodology rigor, and interoperability that are beyond a software build — these are institutional, not just code, gaps.

## 2. Implementation Status vs. the SRD (Functional Requirements)

Legend: ✅ Implemented · 🟡 Partial · ❌ Not implemented · ⏳ Marked "future" in the SRD itself

## 4. Benchmark vs. Real‑World Carbon Markets

Real voluntary‑market registries (Verra's VCS, Gold Standard) and the emerging PH compliance market set the bar Ecolink is measured against.

**How the real registries work (for reference):**
- **Verra (VCS):** developer designs a project under an *approved methodology* → submits a Project Description → **independent third‑party validation by an accredited VVB** → registration → monitoring → **independent third‑party verification** → issuance of serialized VCUs → retirement; all issuances/transfers/retirements are **publicly traceable by serial number**. ([Verra](https://verra.org/programs/verified-carbon-standard/), [SustainCERT](https://www.sustain-cert.com/news/what-are-verra-and-the-verified-carbon-standard))
- **Gold Standard:** generates **unique serial numbers per credit** for full lifecycle traceability (generation → sale → retirement) and is moving toward **digital MRV**. ([Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/project-developers/impact-registry))
- **Integrity bar (ICVCM Core Carbon Principles):** registries must uniquely identify/track each credit, be traceable to the activity, and prevent **double issuance, double claiming, and double use**. ([ICVCM](https://icvcm.org/core-carbon-principles/), [White & Case](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/integrity-voluntary-carbon-market-draft-core-carbon-principles))
- **Next‑gen direction:** Verra + S&P Global are rolling out an API‑driven, Article 6/CORSIA‑compliant registry through 2026. ([Carbon Herald](https://carbonherald.com/verra-and-sp-global-unveil-next-generation-carbon-registry/))
- **Philippines:** the **Low Carbon Economy Act (HB 11375)** passed the House on 3rd reading (June 2025) and moved to the Senate; DENR + CCC + DOF are building the **national MRV system and registry**; a national carbon registry and market blueprint are in progress. The compliance market is *not yet fully operational*. ([ICAP](https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets/philippines), [Fairatmos](https://www.fairatmos.com/blog/philippines-opens-its-carbon-market-the-time-for-action-is-now))

### Feature‑by‑feature comparison

| Capability | Ecolink | Verra / Gold Standard | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project lifecycle (register→validate→verify→issue→trade→retire) | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | **At parity (in shape)** |
| Serialized carbon units | ✅ Per‑unit `ECO‑…` serials | ✅ Industry standard | **At parity** |
| Digital MRV + server‑side ER calculation | ✅ | 🟡 (moving to digital MRV) | **Ahead in digitization** for a prototype |
| Verifier‑gated issuance (1 credit = 1 tCO₂e) | ✅ | ✅ | **At parity** |
| Anti‑double‑counting | 🟡 (retirement locked; purchase oversell partial) | ✅ (issuance/claim/use) | **Behind** — no double‑claim/double‑use controls |
| **Independent accredited VVBs** | ❌ (internal verifier role) | ✅ (mandatory) | **Major gap** |
| **Approved, peer‑reviewed methodologies** | ❌ (simplified IPCC‑style factors) | ✅ | **Major gap** |
| Public registry transparency | 🟡 (per‑cert verify page only) | ✅ (full public registry) | **Behind** |
| Independent governance / integrity labeling (ICVCM CCP) | ❌ | ✅/in‑progress | **Major gap** |
| Interoperability / API / Article 6 corresponding adjustments | ❌ | ✅/in‑progress | **Gap (institutional)** |
| Blockchain/tokenization & immutable ledger | ❌ (planned future) | 🟡 (some registries piloting) | **Parity on "future" status** |
| KYC for buyers/sellers | ✅ | ✅ | **At parity** |
| Financial settlement / escrow | 🟡 (PayMongo, manual confirmation) | ✅ (mature) | **Behind** |
| MFA + RBAC + audit trail | ✅ | ✅ | **At parity** |

**Interpretation:** Ecolink reproduces the *software mechanics* of a credible registry — and in digital MRV it is arguably ahead of where many incumbents were until recently. The gaps that remain are predominantly **institutional/regulatory** (accredited verifiers, approved methodologies, independent governance, national‑registry interoperability), which a capstone cannot satisfy by code alone, plus a few technical items (double‑claim prevention, public registry transparency, blockchain).

## 6. Scorecard by Category

| Category | Score | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| User management & security | 9.5 / 10 | MFA (strict), password reset, RBAC, audit logs, org profiles. |
| Project registration & data fields | 8.5 / 10 | Comprehensive; missing structured boundary + financials module. |
| Validation & verification workflow | 9.0 / 10 | Full workflow; internal (not accredited) verifiers. |
| MRV system | 9.0 / 10 | Server‑side ER calc, evidence, VER approval — strong; methodologies simplified. |
| Issuance & certificates | 9.5 / 10 | Serials, QR, signature, public verify page. |
| Trading & traceability | 7.5 / 10 | Serials + retirement anti‑double‑counting solid; purchase oversell + double‑claim gaps. |
| Marketplace features | 7.0 / 10 | Buy/list/transfer solid; no offers, SDG filter, seller dashboard. |
| LGU tools | 8.5 / 10 | Calculator, diversion, ESG, endorsements; no land‑use modeling. |
| Dashboards & analytics | 8.0 / 10 | Role dashboards, charts, progress tracker, map. |
| Regulatory/institutional readiness | 4.0 / 10 | No accreditation, approved methodologies, or national‑registry link (partly external). |
| **Overall (capstone lens)** | **8.7 / 10** | Excellent academic prototype, PH‑aligned, broad and coherent. |
| **Overall (real‑registry lens)** | **4.5 / 10** | Credible software shell; institutional & methodology rigor outstanding. |

## 7. Recommended Next Steps (highest impact first)

1. **Trading integrity (technical, in‑reach):** consolidate the dual `available_credits`/`credits_available` columns and make the purchase decrement atomic (race‑safe oversell prevention); add a retirement‑claim uniqueness layer to block double‑claim.
2. **Transparency:** a public, searchable registry page (all validated projects + issued/retired serials) — the single biggest credibility signal toward real registries.
3. **MRV reminders + SDG capture:** small, high‑visibility wins that close two SRD/Review items.
4. **Methodology documentation:** publish the emission‑factor sources/assumptions per project type (move from "simplified factors" toward defensible, cited methodologies).
5. **Financial/risk module:** financial‑projection uploads + carbon‑yield analytics for corporate buyers.
6. **Compliance posture:** DPA consent/export/delete; document the path to accredited third‑party verification and eventual national‑registry/Article 6 interoperability.
7. **Future track:** blockchain tokenization/immutable ledger (explicitly future in the SRD).
